            <h1>Hangman Terminal App</h1>
            <p>Working in groups of two we were tasked with creating a Ruby terminal application. With free choice of developing any type of application, my partner and I opted to create Hangman.</p>
            <div class="project-img">
                <img src="images/hangman-2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>This choice was made as we felt that a terminal game had a good balance of complexity and difficulty that was also reasonable for the given time frame of the project. We also just thought it would be cool and enjoyable to create an interactive game.</p>
            <div class="project-img">
                <img src="images/hangman-3.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Since the user is only interacting with the command prompt and reading text we wanted to add another element to the game and make to make it more interesting.</p>
            <div class="project-img">
                    <img src="images/hangman-4.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>We achieved this by creating and implementing sound effects that would play during key moments of the game such as game launch, choosing a category and guessing a letter.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- TECHNOLOGY -->
        <div class="tech">
            <h1>Technology Used</h1>

                <img src="images/github-white.svg" alt="">
            </div>
                <p>The whole application was developed using Ruby with the use of the Faker gem to create the database of words.</p>
                <p>GitHub was also used for version control and collaboration.</p>
